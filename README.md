# fabric8-jenkinsfile-library
This repository contains a library of reusable Jenkinsfiles that you can use on your projects. 

Its reused by the [fabric8 console](http://fabric8.io/guide/console.html) to provide the list of available `Jenkinsfile` items you can configure for your projects.

Or you can just browse this repository, find a `Jenkinsfile` you want to use and copy it into your project's source code!
